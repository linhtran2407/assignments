= Hardware specifications

Where did your run your tests? A laptop, or goldengate?

*Goldengate*

What are the performance specifications of the machine: number and speed of
processors, size of RAM? (use `lscpu` and `free -m`)

*Number and speed of processors:  
CPU(s):                          64  
Model name:                      Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6246R CPU @ 3.40GHz  
CPU MHz:                         1200.049  
CPU max MHz:                     4100.0000  
CPU min MHz:                     1200.0000 

size of RAM:  

              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available  
Mem:          95320       11217       70958           4       13145       83268  
Swap:          8191        1167        7024

= Allocations

In `simple.c`, where does the increase in 1040 bytes come from?
Why is the value 1040 bytes?

*1040 bytes comes from calling printf. printf calls malloc internally to allocate a buffer for stdout. 
the allocated memory has size of 1040 bytes*

How many bytes does `mylloc_list.c` allocate when the program ends? Explain why
this amount makes sense.
